# GLOSSARY

This page provides a brief explanation of the key terms used in Cloud File Transfer.

## API
Application Programming Interface. Refers to a set of functions and procedures that allows two applications to interact with each other programmatically in order to access the features or data of an operating system, application or other service. 

## API Endpoint
Refers to a URL of a server or service, that is, the location from which APIs can access the API resources that they need to carry out the function.

## API Gateway
An API management tool that sits between a client and a collection of backend services. It accepts all API calls, aggregates the various services required to fulfil them, and returns the appropriate result.

## API Key
A unique identifier used by CFT to authenticate a calling program. It is assigned to an individual project and used for rate limiting.

## API Request
A call to a server using an API. It allows you to retrieve data from a data source, or to send data. APIs run on web servers, and expose endpoints to support the operations client applications use to provide their functionality. Each API request uses an HTTP method. The most common methods are GET , POST , PATCH , PUT , and DELETE.

- GET method retrieves data from an API
- POST method sends new data to an API
- PATCH and PUT methods update existing data
- DELETE removes existing data

## API Response
A response is defined by its HTTP status code and the data returned in the response body and/or headers.
For example: 
200 OK - (When the request completes successfully and returns the response body.)

## AIAS
Application Infrastructure Architecture Standard.

## AWS
Amazon Web Services. It is the worldâ€™s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. 

## Client Id and Secret
Refers to the API credentials, required to generate an authorization token to make API calls.

## CFT
Cloud File Transfer. A centralised, fully managed file transfer service for the whole-of-government (WOG). CFT is a part of the Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS) and is hosted on the Government Commercial Cloud (GCC).

## CDR
Content Disarm and Reconstruct also known as Threat Extraction, proactively protects against known and unknown threats contained in documents by removing executable content.

## GCC
The Government Commercial Cloud Service brings the modern innovations and capabilities of commercial cloud computing platforms to less sensitive Government systems. These leading ICT capabilities are augmented by robust cybersecurity measures and systems to protect the data that resides on commercial cloud platforms.


## HTTPS
Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is used for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet.

## IM8
Instruction Manual 8. A management tool used in the Government to safeguard ICT & SS (Infocomm Technology and Smart Systems) assets and guides all Government agencies in adopting ICT & SS to enable their digital transformation.


## JWT
JSON Web Token is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

## KMS
Key Management Service by AWS helps you create and manage cryptographic keys and control their use across a wide range of AWS services and in your applications.

## Malware Scanning
The process of detecting malware in a file.

## OpenAPI Specifications
The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection.

## Payload
The body of an API request or response message.

## PGP
Pretty Good Privacy is an encryption program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication. 

## REST API
A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style.

## Sandbox
The CFT sandbox is a secure test environment for you to try out CFT APIs for file transfers between systems in the internet zone.

## Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS)
SGTS consists of a series of common applications and platforms built by the Government that helps agencies build compliant applications easily.

## Amazon S3
Amazon Simple Storage Service is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.

## SSE
Streaming SIMD Extensions is a processor technology that enables single instruction multiple data. It enables the instructions to handle multiple data elements.

## TechPass
A Single Sign-On, Identity & Access Management solution for developer services in SGTS, enabling users to transition seamlessly between services, while providing downstream services for a seamless onboarding and consumption experience.

## Webhook
A way for an application to provide other applications with real-time information.
