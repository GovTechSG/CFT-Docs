# Try out CFT Sandbox

## The Sandbox Environment
Cloud File Transfer (CFT) sandbox is a test environment that is almost identical to our production environment except that it supports only internet to internet transfers. It offers you a space to run file transfers with dummy files, test the API fully, and get a feel of the file transfer process before applying for a production account.
