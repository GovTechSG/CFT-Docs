# What is CFT?
Cloud File Transfer(CFT) is a centralized, fully managed file transfer service for the whole-of-government (WOG). It is hosted on the Government Commercial Cloud (GCC).

With CFT, agencies can reliably automate the exchange of files with their business partners, vendors, and other agencies across internet and intranet zones.
