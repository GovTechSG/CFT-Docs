# What is Cloud File Transfer (CFT)?

CFT is a centralized, fully managed file transfer service for the whole-of-government (WOG). 
With CFT, agencies can reliably automate the exchange of files with their business partners, vendors, and other agencies across internet and intranet zones.

CFT is a part of the service layer in Singapore Government Tech Stack (SGTS).
