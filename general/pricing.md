# CFT indicative pricing

!> **Important:** Pricing below is provisional and subject to change pending approval.

CFT cost recovery begins FY25. 

We kindly request your assistance in obtaining feedback from your stakeholders on our proposed pricing structure. Please share your feedback using the [CFT Usage and Pricing Survey](https://form.gov.sg/671dfd83e0339adec428ccfa) or reach out to **Brian Liu (Product Manager)** at brian_liu@tech.gov.sg.
 
## Cost formula 
**Proposed CFT Pricing (per month) = Cost per transfer + Cost per GB**
 
Please refer to Tables 1 and 2 below for the cost breakdown.

?> **Note:** The number of file transfers per month will be based on the total number of files uploaded by the Sender Applications in your CFT Project’s Workflows.

## Cost 1: Cost per transfer

The Cost per transfer rate is *progressive* based on the number of files.

**Example 1**

- In Jan '24:
    - 10,000 files transferred in "Workflow A" 
    - 5,000 files transferred in "Workflow B" 
    - 87,000 files transferred in "Workflow C"
- **Total Files:** 102,000 <br>

Based on Table 1, the total number of files will be broken down into: 102,000 files = 1,000 files + 9,000 files + 90,000 files + 2,000 files.

Computation = *(1,000 x **1.25**) + (9,000 x **0.25**) + (90,000 x **0.05**) + (2,000 x **0.01**)*

➡️ **Total Cost per transfer for the month =  $8,020** 

## Cost 2: Cost per GB pricing

CFT Cost per GB is based on the **features** used per Workflow.

**Example 2** 

- You have 3 Workflows:
    - Workflow1 utilised 2 GB, with $2.50/GB rate
    - Workflow2 utilised 10 GB, with $1.50/GB rate
    - Workflow3 utilised 5 GB, with $1.00/GB rate

Computation = *(2 x **2.50**) + (10 x **1.5**) + (5 x **1.00**)*

➡️ **Total Cost per GB for the Month: $25**

## Total Cost

**Total Monthly Cost** = [Cost per transfer](#cost-1-cost-per-transfer) + [Cost per GB](#cost-2-cost-per-gb-pricing)

- **Cost per transfer**: $8,020 (See example 1 above)
- **Cost per GB**: $25 (See example 2 above)

**Total Monthly Cost** = $8,020 + $25

➡️ **Total Monthly Cost= $8,045**
