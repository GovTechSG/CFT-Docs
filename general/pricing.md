## Cost formula 
**Proposed CFT Pricing (per month) = Cost Per Transfer + Cost per GB**
 
Please refer to Tables 1 and 2 below for the cost breakdown.

?> **Note:** The number of file transfers per month will be based on the total number of files uploaded by the Sender Applications in your CFT Project’s Workflows.

## Cost 1: Cost per transfer

![pricing](/assets/indicative-pricing-table1.png)

The Cost Per Transfer rate is *progressive* based on the number of files.

**Example 1**

- In Jan '24:
    - 10,000 files transferred in "Workflow A" 
    - 5,000 files transferred in "Workflow B" 
    - 87,000 files transferred in "Workflow C"
- **Total Files:** 102,000 <br>

Based on Table 1, the total number of files will be broken down into: 102,000 files = 1,000 files + 9,000 files + 90,000 files + 2,000 files.

Computation = *(1,000 x **1.25**) + (9,000 x **0.25**) + (90,000 x **0.05**) + (2,000 x **0.01**)*

➡️ **Total Cost Per Transfer for the month =  $8,020** 

## Cost 2: Cost per GB pricing

CFT Cost Per GB is based on the **features** used per Workflow. 

**Example 2** 

- You have 3 Workflows:
    - Workflow1 utilised 2 GB, with $2.50/GB rate
    - Workflow2 utilised 10 GB, with $1.50/GB rate
    - Workflow3 utilised 5 GB, with $1.00/GB rate

Computation = *(2 x **2.50**) + (10 x **1.5**) + (5 x **1.00**)*

➡️ **Total Cost Per GB for the Month: $25**

## Total Cost

![pricing](/assets/indicative-pricing-table2.png)

**Total Monthly Cost** = [Cost Per Transfer](#cost-1-cost-per-transfer) + [Cost per GB](#cost-2-cost-per-gb-pricing)

- **Cost Per Transfer**: $8,020 (See example 1 above)
- **Cost Per GB**: $25 (See example 2 above)

**Total Monthly Cost** = $8,020 + $25

➡️ **Total Monthly Cost= $8,045**
