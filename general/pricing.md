# CFT Pricing

!> CFT will implement billing through [TechBiz](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/platform/techbiz/overview.html) starting **1 July 2025**. This page outlines the proposed and indicative pricing to help you plan accordingly. Additional details about TechBiz onboarding will be shared soon.

?> Please be informed that while our pricing methodology and structure have been substantially finalised, the figures presented are currently undergoing review and may be subject to modification. We value your patience and understanding during this process.<br><br>
We assure you that Tenants will be provided with sufficient advance notice prior to the implementation of any charges. Further details will be communicated once CFT's pricing has received approval and the TechBiz billing mechanism has been fully developed.<br><br>
 We remain committed to keeping you informed throughout this process and appreciate your continued engagement.

## Proposed and Indicative pricing

There are two pricing structures provided: **Proposed Pricing** (our intended structure) and **Indicative Pricing** (the maximum potential cost). 

**For AOR and budgeting purposes, please use the indicative pricing values.** 

###  Cost formula 

**Monthly CFT Cost = Cost per Transfer + Cost per GB**
 
Please refer to Tables 1 and 2 below for the cost breakdown.  (Click the image to enlarge.)

<center><small><b>For AOR or budgeting purposes, use the values in the indicative pricing column. </b></small></center>

?> **Note:** Monthly transfer counts are based on the total files uploaded by Sender Applications in your CFT Project's Workflows.

### High-volume monthly transfer example

The examples provided follow the Proposed pricing structure.

#### Cost 1: Cost per transfer

The Cost per transfer rate is *progressive* based on the number of files.

<center><small><b>For AOR or budgeting purposes, use the values in the indicative pricing column. </b></small></center>

**Example 1**

- In January 2024:
    - 10,000 files transferred in "Workflow A" 
    - 5,000 files transferred in "Workflow B" 
    - 87,000 files transferred in "Workflow C"
- **Total Files:** 102,000 files <br>

Based on Table 1, the total number of files will be broken down into: 102,000 files = 1,000 files + 9,000 files + 90,000 files + 2,000 files.

Computation = *(1,000 x **1.25**) + (9,000 x **0.25**) + (90,000 x **0.05**) + (2,000 x **0.01**)*

➡️ **Total Cost per transfer for the month =  $8,020** 

#### Cost 2: Cost per GB pricing

CFT Cost per GB is based on the **features** used per Workflow.

<center><small><b>For AOR or budgeting purposes, use the values in the indicative pricing column. </b></small></center>

**Example 2** 

- You have 3 Workflows:
    - Workflow1 utilised 2 GB, with $2.50/GB rate
    - Workflow2 utilised 10 GB, with $1.50/GB rate
    - Workflow3 utilised 5 GB, with $1.00/GB rate

Computation = *(2 x **2.50**) + (10 x **1.5**) + (5 x **1.00**)*

➡️ **Total Cost per GB for the Month: $25**

#### Total Cost

**Total Monthly Cost** = [Cost per transfer](#cost-1-cost-per-transfer) + [Cost per GB](#cost-2-cost-per-gb-pricing)

- **Cost per transfer**: $8,020 (See example 1 above)
- **Cost per GB**: $25 (See example 2 above)

**Total Monthly Cost** = $8,020 + $25

➡️ **Total Monthly Cost= $8,045**

### Low-volume monthly transfer example

The examples provided follow the Proposed pricing structure.

#### Cost 1: Cost per transfer

**Example 3**

- In Jan '24:
    - 10 files transferred in "Workflow A" 
    - 5 files transferred in "Workflow B" 
    - 30 files transferred in "Workflow C"
- **Total Files:** 45 files <br>


Computation = *(45 x **1.25**)*

➡️ **Total Cost per transfer for the month =  $56.25** 

#### Cost 2: Cost per GB pricing

**Example 4** 

- You have 3 Workflows:
    - Workflow1 utilised 10 GB, with $2.50/GB rate
    - Workflow2 utilised 10 GB, with $1.50/GB rate
    - Workflow3 utilised 5 GB, with $1.00/GB rate

Computation = *(10 x **2.50**) + (10 x **1.5**) + (5 x **1.00**)*

➡️ **Total Cost per GB for the Month: $45**

#### Total Cost

**Total Monthly Cost** = [Cost per transfer](#cost-1-cost-per-transfer) + [Cost per GB](#cost-2-cost-per-gb-pricing)

- **Cost per transfer**: $8,020 (See example 1 above)
- **Cost per GB**: $25 (See example 2 above)

**Total Monthly Cost** = $56.25 + $45 

➡️ **Total Monthly Cost= $101.25**

## Billing Timeline

From 1 July 2025, CFT will officially start billing using the  [TechBiz](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/platform/techbiz/overview.html) service management tool. Until 30th June, you can still use CFT free of charge.

## CFT Environments 

All transfers processed in CFT are chargeable. CFT does not differentiate between Production and Non-Production transfers, as the services consumed remain the same between the two environments.
