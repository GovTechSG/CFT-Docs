# CFT Pricing

!> CFT will implement billing through [TechBiz](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/platform/techbiz/overview.html) starting **1 July 2025**. This page outlines the [CFT cost calculation](#cft-cost) using [proposed and indicative pricing rates](#understanding-proposed-and-indicative-pricing-rates) to help you plan and budget accordingly. Additional details about TechBiz onboarding will be shared soon.

?> Please be informed that while our pricing methodology and structure have been substantially finalised, the figures presented are currently undergoing review and may be subject to modification. We value your patience and understanding during this process.

<small>If you are new to CFT and have pricing questions, please contact us using [this form](https://form.gov.sg/665978af9040a6be24d3978b?665982626cae0284c464a22a=Cloud+File+Transfer).

## CFT Cost

To calculate for total CFT cost per month, there are two components to be considered. The Cost Per Transfer and the Cost Per GB (feature usage).

**CFT Cost = [Cost per Transfer](#cost-per-transfer) + [Cost per GB](#cost-per-gb)**

The following sections will give a more detailed breakdown on these components.

Note that while final pricing rates are still being reviewed, there are Proposed Pricing and Indicative Pricing rates provided. Refer to [Understanding Proposed and Indicative Pricing Rates](#understanding-proposed-and-indicative-pricing-rates) to learn more.

### Cost Per Transfer

The Cost Per Transfer rates are progressive based on the number of files sent. 

?> **Note:** Monthly transfer counts are based on the total files uploaded by Sender Applications in your CFT Project's Workflows. Each zipped folder is counted as a single file transfer.

### Cost Per GB

The Cost per GB is based on the features enabled or used per Workflow and the total size of the transfers (GB). 

?> Note: The size of a zipped folder is calculated based on the total size of its extracted contents, not the compressed size.

## Understanding Proposed and Indicative Pricing Rates

![pricing](/assets/indicative-proposed-pricing.png)

From the cost tables in the previous sections, there are two pricing rates provided.

**Proposed Pricing**
- These are our intended rates that are currently pending approval

**Indicative Pricing**
- These represent the upper range of the potential approved cost 
- These provide a conservative estimate for AOR and budgeting purposes

## Sample Computations

Use these examples to estimate your CFT costs based on your current usage.

### Sample 1: High-volume Monthly Transfers

<u>Cost 1: Cost per transfer</u>

Note: The example provided is calculated using the [Proposed Pricing numbers](#understanding-proposed-and-indicative-pricing-rates).

- In January 2024:
    - 10,000 files transferred in "Workflow A" 
    - 5,000 files transferred in "Workflow B" 
    - 87,000 files transferred in "Workflow C"
- **Total Files:** 102,000 files <br>

Based on [Table 1](#cost-per-transfer), the total number of files will be broken down into: 102,000 files = 1,000 files + 9,000 files + 90,000 files + 2,000 files.

Computation = *(1,000 x **1.25**) + (9,000 x **0.25**) + (90,000 x **0.05**) + (2,000 x **0.01**)*

➡️ **Total Cost per transfer for the month =  $8,020** 

<u>Cost 2: Cost per GB pricing</u>

Note: The example provided is calculated using the [Proposed Pricing numbers](#understanding-proposed-and-indicative-pricing-rates).

- You have 3 Workflows:
    - Workflow1 utilised 2 GB, with $2.50/GB rate
    - Workflow2 utilised 10 GB, with $1.50/GB rate
    - Workflow3 utilised 5 GB, with $1.00/GB rate

Computation using [Table 2](#cost-per-gb) = *(2 x **2.50**) + (10 x **1.5**) + (5 x **1.00**)*

➡️ **Total Cost per GB for the Month: $25**

<u>Total Cost</u>

**Total Monthly Cost** = Cost per transfer + Cost per GB

- **Cost per transfer**: $8,020 
- **Cost per GB**: $25 

**Total Monthly Cost** = $8,020 + $25

➡️ **Final Monthly Cost= $8,045**

### Sample 2: Low-volume Monthly Transfers

<u>Cost 1: Cost per transfer</u>

Note: The example provided is calculated using the [Proposed Pricing numbers](#understanding-proposed-and-indicative-pricing-rates).

- In Jan '24:
    - 10 files transferred in "Workflow A" 
    - 5 files transferred in "Workflow B" 
    - 30 files transferred in "Workflow C"
- **Total Files:** 45 files <br>

Computation using [Table 1](#cost-per-transfer) = *(45 x **1.25**)*

➡️ **Total Cost per transfer for the month =  $56.25** 

<u>Cost 2: Cost per GB pricing</u>

Note: The example provided is calculated using the [Proposed Pricing numbers](#understanding-proposed-and-indicative-pricing-rates).

- You have 3 Workflows:
    - Workflow1 utilised 10 GB, with $2.50/GB rate
    - Workflow2 utilised 10 GB, with $1.50/GB rate
    - Workflow3 utilised 5 GB, with $1.00/GB rate

Computation using [Table 2](#cost-per-gb) = *(10 x **2.50**) + (10 x **1.5**) + (5 x **1.00**)*

➡️ **Total Cost per GB for the Month: $45**

<u>Total Cost</u>

**Total Monthly Cost** = Cost per transfer + Cost per GB

- **Cost per transfer**: $56.25
- **Cost per GB**: $45

**Total Monthly Cost** = $56.25 + $45 

➡️ **Final Monthly Cost= $101.25**

## Billing Timeline

From 1 July 2025, CFT will officially start billing using the  [TechBiz](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/platform/techbiz/overview.html) service management tool. Until 30th June, you can still use CFT free of charge.

## CFT Environments 

All transfers processed in CFT are chargeable. CFT does not differentiate between Production and Non-Production transfers, as the services consumed remain the same between the two environments.
